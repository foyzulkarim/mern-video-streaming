## Overview

MERN Video Streaming is a cutting-edge, open-source platform for video
streaming, offering a comprehensive, full-stack solution utilizing the latest
MERN stack technologies. With MERN Video Streaming, users can easily upload,
manage, and stream videos on demand, providing a seamless experience. This
project features a video processing capability that provides real-time
notifications upon completion.

The backend is comprised of three services, utilizing Redis messaging for
communication. These include an API server, a video conversion service, and an
HTTP server serving HLS video files. On the client side, the project uses
create-react-app and MUI library, along with socket.io-client and React Context.

## Architecture

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/497812/220627727-04a26928-71df-4c9b-9637-92289a2beee2.png)

### Backend Services

#### API Server

The API server is an Expressjs app that uses Joi, Multer, BullMQ, Socket.io, and
MongoDB driver. The server communicates with Redis to process and store data,
and uses MongoDB as the primary database. The database and Redis are spun up via
the docker-compose command.

#### Video Conversion Service

The video conversion service is a node process that is responsible for
converting videos and communicating with Redis via the BullMQ library. The
service is not exposed to any HTTP port.

#### HTTP Server

The HTTP server is a plain and simple server that serves HLS video files.

### Frontend app

The client app is based on create-react-app and MUI library. It uses
socket.io-client and React Context to communicate with the API server and
display the video content.

### Elastic Stack

Elastic stack is used for monitoring log and api performance. Backend system is not 
dependent on Elastic Stack meaning `Backend system` can run without `Elastic Stack`.

see `Elastic Stack` documentation [here](server/EKA-docker/README.md)

  user and video data
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - A Node.js web application framework used
  for the server-side of the application
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user
  interfaces used for the client-side of the application
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime environment used to
  run the server-side code
